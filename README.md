# Lily's Fake Bank App

This web app was designed to show a number based on Lily's fake savings account. This is how much money she has in savings. This web app displays on a screen in her room, and as she earns more money, the app is updated to reflect the new amount based on updating the data base it reads from.

Bank Account is Displayed at
Localhost:3000

In order to update the savings, the adult will use localhost:3000/update.

This is a simple web app for a child and has no auth checks or validation. When updating the account, the adult needs to enter numbers and not text.

Setup:

Start Webapp by running:
`cd Frontend/ && npm run dev`

Start the API Backend by running:
`cd Backend/ && npm start`

You can also use the script command to start both the web app and api server
`./start.sh`
